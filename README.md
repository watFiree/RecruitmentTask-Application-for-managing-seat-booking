#### Application prepared for the recruitment process. The goal was to create an application allowing to reserve seats like in the cinema. There is also an implementation of the seat proposal. You can choose whether your seats should be next to each other or not. You can provide any database of seats and it will create a map of it and also allow you to reserve seats. The data should look like below:

```javascript
const seat = {
  id: 's01',

  cords: {
    x: 0,

    y: 1,
  },

  reserved: false,
};
```
